# pylava

pylava is a [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink) implementation
for [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) `ext.commands` framework
bots.

Documentation can be found [here](https://pylava.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Version Compatability

pylava is fully compatible with Lavalink version 2. It should hypothetically
also work fine with version 3.

## Installation

pylava is not on PyPi yet. As such, the preferred installation method is
by cloning the git repository:

pip install -U git+https://github.com/Pandentia/pylava@stable
```

You may also wish to clone development versions of the library as follows:
